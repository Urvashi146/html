    <h2>let</h2>
The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

Variables defined with let must be declared before use.

Variables defined with let have block scope.

with let you can not do this
let x = "John Doe";

let x = 0;</pre>

<h2>Block Scope</h2>
JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.<br>
ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

<hr>
<h2>const</h2>
<pre>
The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
